# ECE 354 Real-time Operating System

ECE 354 Course Project. A Real-time Operating System built under the 68K
architecture for a Motorola Coldfire 5307 board.

OS comes with a scheduler, memory management, process management, and a
wall-clock :)

Includes an implementation of the GNU Project Debugger (GDB), which was used to
debug the OS in the Eclipse IDE.
